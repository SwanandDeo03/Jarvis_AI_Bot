      "jarvis": "Strengths of Computer Vision include its ability to perform tasks such as object detection, recognition, and classification automatically and at a scale that humans cannot achieve, making it useful in various industries like autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, medical imaging analysis, and more.\n\nWeaknesses of Computer Vision can include:\n\n1. Sensitivity to lighting conditions and image quality: Computer vision algorithms can struggle with images that are too dark, too bright, or have poor resolution, resulting in reduced accuracy.\n2. Lack of contextual understanding: Unlike humans, computer vision systems do not understand the context of an image. For example, a system might identify a person in a photograph but won't know if they're smiling, crying, or engaged in an activity.\n3. Limited generalization: Computer vision models are typically trained on large datasets for specific tasks, which can limit their ability to generalize well to new and diverse scenarios.\n4. Dependence on labeled data: The performance of computer vision systems relies heavily on the quality and quantity of the labeled training data they're provided. Creating high-quality labeled data can be time-consuming and expensive.\n5. High computational requirements: Running complex computer vision models often requires powerful hardware, making it challenging to deploy these systems on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones or edge devices.",
